       "   - You must be a postpaid customer who needs extra time to pay your bill.\n",
       "   - Your account must be less than 30 days past due to initiate a payment arrangement.\n",
       "   - Any balance that is 31 or more days past due must be paid before you can set up a payment arrangement.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Steps to Set Up a Payment Arrangement**:\n",
       "   - Open the **T-Life** app or log in to your T-Mobile account online.\n",
       "   - Go to the **Manage** tab.\n",
       "   - Choose **Set up a payment arrangement**.\n",
       "   - Edit the payment amount, payment method, and payment date as necessary.\n",
       "   - Once you’ve set it up, select **Agree** and submit.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Important Notes**:\n",
       "   - If the payment arrangement fails, you will be unenrolled from AutoPay.\n",
       "   - Make sure each installment is paid by the specified due date and pay all new bills that become due during the arrangement by the due date.\n",
       "   - If you need to delete a payment arrangement, you can do so once the entire past-due balance is paid off.\n",
